        "1. Contiguous Memory Allocation (NumPy):\n",
        "NumPy arrays are implemented in a way that the data is stored in contiguous memory blocks (in C-style arrays). This allows for direct access to memory locations and efficient manipulation of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you slice a NumPy array, it doesn't create a copy of the data. Instead, it returns a view on the original array, meaning it points to the same memory location but with adjusted indexing. This allows NumPy to avoid extra memory allocations and speed up slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dynamic Array (Python Lists):\n",
        "Python lists are more general-purpose containers that can hold elements of any type. Internally, Python lists are implemented as arrays of pointers to objects, not the objects themselves. This means that slicing a list requires more overhead since Python needs to handle each element individually and might need to allocate new memory to store the sliced portion.\n",

        "When you slice a Python list, a new list object is created, and it copies the relevant items into this new list. This copying operation adds extra time.\n",

        "3. Optimized Low-Level Operations (NumPy):\n",
        "NumPy is built using highly optimized C code under the hood. When you perform operations on NumPy arrays, it leverages low-level, vectorized operations that are more efficient than Python’s built-in list operations. These operations are compiled and CPU optimized, making slicing much faster in NumPy than Python lists.\n",

        "NumPy slices, on the other hand, create views rather than copies. This is why slicing a NumPy array does not involve any data copying, which leads to significant performance improvements when working with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Memory Efficiency (NumPy):\n",
        "NumPy is more memory-efficient than Python lists, especially for large datasets. This is because NumPy arrays are homogeneous (all elements are of the same type and size), whereas Python lists are heterogeneous and require additional overhead for storing type information for each element.\n",
